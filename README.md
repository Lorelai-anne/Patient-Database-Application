# Patient Database Application

The Patient Database Application is a Java-based system developed to manage patient records, medication information, and pharmacist authentication. The application allows both pharmacists and patients to interact with the database, enabling pharmacists to authenticate themselves and manage patient data, while patients can update their own information stored in the database.
